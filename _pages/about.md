## my professional life

As a Data Scientist / Data Engineer and I enjoy many aspects of data and thrive on supporting companies in their data driven journeys. 

Starting January 2020, I worked as a Data Scientist in an aspiring E-commerce company in Germany.
I enjoyed developing and deploying robust Python microservices with Flask, Docker, Tensorflow, Kubernetes, Mysql, etc. My focus areas were backend development and predictive models, like Neural Networks. Additionally, our nifty team optimized a variety of E-commerce processes from purchases and warehousing to shipments.

My current focus areas are data pipelines and data management in the cloud and on-premise using GCP, Bigquery, Terraform (opentofu), Spark, Airflow and the Hadoop ecosystem. Additionally, I research genAI use cases and development of customer-centric data products within a data mesh architecture.

## my scientific projects

As a Ph.D. student at the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, I investigated the genetic history and profile of human populations in Vietnam.

To our knowledge, Southeast Asia and the Sahul continent (former landmass of Australia, Tasmania, and New Guinea) were the first areas that were colonized by early modern humans after the out of Africa migration. Although the highlands of New Guinea and Australia have been relatively isolated, there is evidence for multiple demographic events that shaped the populations of Southeast Asia and Oceania within the last 30 thousand years.

I am interested in investigating the genetic history of these regions. As part of my Ph.D. project, I am focusing on the populations of Vietnam as one of the enigmatic fragments of Mainland Southeast Asia. By analyzing sequences from both full mitochondrial genomes and the Y chromosome as well as genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) I want to reconstruct the evolutionary processes and demographic events that led to the diversity we find in modern-day Vietnamese populations.

## my other projects

I am a coder, novice game dev, and maker. I create and develop these projects for fun. Go, take a look at the [Game Development](https://emacholdt.github.io/gamedev/), and [Maker Projects](https://emacholdt.github.io/maker/) pages for a small insight into my Android games, and more.
